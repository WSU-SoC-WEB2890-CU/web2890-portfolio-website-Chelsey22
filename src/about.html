          Hi, I'm <strong>Chelsey Langston</strong>—a senior Computer Science student at Weber State University with a deep interest in full-stack development, user experience, and building tools that make people's lives easier.
          Whether it's designing responsive web applications or writing efficient backend logic, I love turning ideas into functional, user-friendly software.
        </p>
        <p>
          My journey into coding began in high school, where I took my first introductory computer science class. What started as a curiosity quickly turned into a passion, I was fascinated by the idea that I could write lines of code and create something functional, even powerful. That early exposure opened the door to problem solving in
          a new way and sparked a sense of creativity. I remember the satisfaction of writing my first program and realizing that I wanted to keep building, keep learning, and see how far I could take it. That experience laid the foundation for my decision to pursue a degree in Computer Science and continues to motivate me every day.
          As a student, I've worked on several academic and personal projects that have helped me gain hands-on experience with languages and frameworks such as <strong>Python</strong>, <strong>JavaScript</strong>, <strong>React</strong>, and <strong>Django</strong>. I enjoy learning new technologies and am constantlypushing myself to grow as a developer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of tech, I'm engaged and am a proud parent of four amazing kids. Juggling family life with the demands of school has taught me discipline, time management, and the importance of staying focused under pressure.
          These experiences have shaped me into someone who's not only a team player, but also highly adaptable and
          dependable.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm currently looking for opportunities—whether internships, freelance work, or entry-level roles—where I can continue learning, contribute meaningfully, and collaborate with others to build impactful solutions. If
          you're looking for someone who brings both technical ability and a grounded, determined work ethic, I'd love to connect. Click the button below to download my resume.
